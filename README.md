📝 John's To-Do Tracker

Welcome to my first web app project! This lightweight to-do list helps users keep track of their tasks, mark them complete, and filter based on status—all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎯 Purpose
I created this to:
- Learn how to visualise what a working programme looks like
- Use it to be able to add more bits on as i learn how to do them

🚀 Features
- ✅ Add and delete tasks
- 🔁 Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- 🗂️ Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Done)

📁 File Overview
| File         | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Main app layout and logic                 |
| `style.css`  | Visual styling                            |
